# Next.js 15 Runtime Error: JSON.parse Failure in Client-Side Rendering
This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Next.js 15 applications during client-side rendering. The error occurs when attempting to parse JSON from localStorage without proper error handling, specifically when localStorage.getItem('user') returns null.

## Issue Description
The `pages/about.js` file attempts to parse data from localStorage using `JSON.parse()`. If no data is present, `JSON.parse()` throws an error, resulting in a runtime exception during client-side hydration.  This is a common issue that can be easily fixed using proper error handling.

## Solution
The solution is provided in `pages/aboutSolution.js`.  This version includes a check for null before attempting to parse the JSON. This ensures that the application gracefully handles the case where no user data exists.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server.
4. Navigate to `/about`.
5. Observe that initially, the application crashes.  After implementing the solution, the crash will be resolved.

## Steps to resolve the issue
1. Implement proper error handling when parsing JSON from localStorage.  Check for null before attempting to parse the JSON string.
2. Use optional chaining and nullish coalescing to handle potential null values gracefully.
3. Consider using a more robust state management solution if your application requires more complex data handling.
